# Virtual_Mouse
This Python script integrates MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI libraries to create a system that interprets hand gestures captured via webcam for controlling mouse actions, showcasing an application of computer vision and gesture recognition in enhancing user interaction with computers.
This project is made basically for fun but also for learning the concepts of OpenCV, Mediapipe and PyAutoGUI.
It is useful when you are a little far from your laptop or when you donâ€™t wanna come out of the blanket to pause or play your favorite movie
# Virtual_Mouse.py
  This is best optimised for single hand usage and you can use it for clicking and moving, right click and holding options are also added but does not work very well
  
# Virtual_Mouse_both_hands.py
  This is made for controlling the mouse by both hands. here you can move the mouse by making this symbol with your hands, and the cursor will move relative to your fingertips
